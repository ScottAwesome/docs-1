Stately Studio is a suite of tools for building app logic, including the Studio Editor, [developer tools for XState](developer-tools.mdx), and much more coming soon.

</p>

You can use [Stately Studio’s editor](#studio-editor) to model your logic using state machines and statecharts visually; no code required! Collaborate on your machines with coworkers and friends with [shared projects in teams](/#projects-and-teams). Use the [XState VS Code extension](xstate-vscode-extension.mdx) to use the editor with your codebase inside your code editor, or [export](/#export) your code from Stately Studio into your codebase.

What are state machines and statecharts? We’re glad you asked! [Check out our no-code introduction to state machines and statecharts](state-machines-and-statecharts.mdx).

## Stately Studio’s editor

Stately Studio’s editor supports everything you need to visually build state machines and statecharts. The editor currently has two modes; **Design** mode for creating your machines and **Simulate** mode for simulating how your machine works.

### Design mode

<p>
  <ThemedImage

    sources={{
      light: '/editor.png',
      dark: '/editor-dm.png',
    }}
  />
</p>

Visually add, modify, and delete states, events, and transitions, as well as data, including actions, descriptions, and invoked actors.

### Simulate mode

<p>
  <ThemedImage

    sources={{
      light: '/simulate.png',
      dark: '/simulate-dm.png',
    }}
  />
</p>

Run the statechart, trigger events, and see the active state nodes.

### Export

You can also export machines to JSON, JavaScript and TypeScript, ready to be used in your codebase with [XState](./xstate.mdx).

## Projects and teams

<p>

    }}
  />
</p>

As a [Pro user](https://stately.ai/pricing), you can create and join teams in Stately Studio to share your machines and collaborate on private team projects. [Read more about Projects](projects.mdx) and [Teams](teams.mdx).

## Discover machines

Are you seeking inspiration for your machine? Or do you want to learn from how somebody else models their machines? The [Discover page](https://stately.ai/registry/discover) lists all the public machines created with Stately Studio. [Read more about the Discover page](discover.mdx).
